# synthesizer-lab
An exploration in SwiftUI that delves into the physics behind soundwaves.

## Instructions
### Run the program:
Download `synthesizer-lab-program.zip` and unzip the file. Open this unzipped file with Swift Playgrounds and enjoy! (Requires Apple device.)

### View the code 
Head into `synthesizer-lab-root` for access to all the files on any machine :)

## About
Over April Break, I challenged myself to learn as much SwiftUI as possible over four days. I am very fascinated by the science and mathematics behind sound waves, so I figured that the best way to combine both my interests was by building a Synthesizer Lab!

Through the project, I spent a LOT of time trying to wrap my head around the ways in which SwiftUI deals with gradients, layers, animations, and sound output.

## Credits
The code in `synthesizer-lab-root/SynthesizerLab/Helpers/PlaySynth` is modified from `pure_tone.swift` by yenrab on Github (I could not wrap my head around AVFoundation for the LIFE of me, so massive thanks to them). Check them out here: https://gist.github.com/yenrab/4076b391b6c50b3d195c42ab8cf3b486. Support for the synthesization of multiple wave shapes was added by myself.
